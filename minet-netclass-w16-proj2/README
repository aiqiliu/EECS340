WORK SPLITUP:
Kevin Cheng:
•  Implemented parts 14, 15, 22, 23, 25
•  Debugged the MUX states and closing the connection 

Agam Gupta:
•  Implemented parts 12, 13, 20, 21
•  Create helper functions to make the code more consistent and efficient

Aiqi Liu:
•  Implemented parts 16, 24, 26
•  Read about RFC793 and Minet TCP/IP Stack, and informed team members of the state transitions

Notes about the program:
•  When testing out the passive close, everything works on the server side. The server transitions from the ESTABLISHED state to 
the CLOSE_WAIT state to the LAST_ACK state correctly. However, during the LAST_ACK state, the server never receives the final ACK from 
netcat. We think this may be a problem on netcat's end.
